# Project1337
Project1337 is a Win32 program that blocks off the screen with black upon
request until a specific set of keys is pressed, currently Z, P and ` in that
order. More information is available in the dialog that appears on startup.

## Building
I'm sorry to say that I'm not aware of how to build this on the command line.
To build graphically, use Visual Studio.

If you need to build it on the command line, then you can try building it by
linking it to `comctl32.lib`.
